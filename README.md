# Introductory

Physics aims to describe the function of everything around us, from the movement of tiny charged particles to the motion of people, cars, and spaceships. In fact, almost everything around you can be described quite accurately by the laws of physics.

# Problem

We want to cross the river and our boat is going twice slower than the current of the river.

In which direction (angle) must we steer the boat so that the distance to the starting point is shortest?

Let η be a ratio of Vr and Vb, where Vr is the velocity of river and Vb velocity of boat.

Explain what means if η<1, η=1 and η>1.

Find optimal angles for η=0.05, 0.10, 0.15, …. 5. (100 solutions)

For which η’s (interval!) do you obtain real and imaginary solutions? What about η=1?

Plot function d(α) in for η<1, η=1 and η>1 for a interval α=[0 , Pi].

What is the relation (describe) between “3 plots”, real and imaginary solutions?

We find α=120 degrees for η=2. Calculate d and plot a sketch: river flow, xo, d, α, ...
